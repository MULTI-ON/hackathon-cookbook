# MultiOn Cookbook

The MultiOn Cookbook provides recipes and guides designed to help developers build with [MultiOn](https://www.multion.ai/api), providing code snippets that you can easily integrate into your own projects.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of the examples in this cookbook, you'll need an MultiOn account and API key (sign up [here](https://app.multion.ai)).

Some recipes use the Agent API in local mode, which requires the MultiOn Chrome Extension (install [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/multion/ddmjhdbknfidiopmbaceghhhbgbpenmm)).
